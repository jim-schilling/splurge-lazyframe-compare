# Codebase Simplification and Decomposition Plan

## Executive Summary

This document outlines a **comprehensive architectural redesign** of the `splurge_lazyframe_compare` codebase. As this is an initial feature branch with **no backward compatibility constraints**, we can perform a complete restructuring that eliminates technical debt and implements modern design patterns from the ground up.

The current architecture has grown organically with large, multi-purpose modules that mix concerns. This plan proposes a cleaner, more modular structure that aggressively follows SOLID principles and establishes a solid foundation for future development.

## Current Architecture Analysis

### Module Complexity Metrics

| Module | Lines | Classes | Responsibilities | Issues |
|--------|-------|---------|------------------|---------|
| `comparator.py` | 467 | 1 | Comparison logic, validation, data preparation | Large single class, mixed concerns |
| `results.py` | 675 | 4 | Results containers, reporting, export | Multiple classes, presentation mixed with data |
| `schema.py` | 226 | 4 | Schema definitions, validation, configuration | Data models mixed with business logic |
| `data_validators.py` | 335 | 2 | Data quality validation | Large validator class with multiple responsibilities |
| `type_helpers.py` | 57 | 0 | Type utility functions | Single responsibility, well-structured |

### Current Issues

1. **Large monolithic classes** with multiple responsibilities
2. **Mixed concerns** (data models + business logic + presentation)
3. **Limited use of class-level constants** for configuration
4. **Deep inheritance hierarchies** in exceptions
5. **Scattered utility functions** without clear organization
6. **Tight coupling** between components

## Proposed Simplified Architecture

### 1. Core Data Models (`models/`)

**Create dedicated package for data structures:**

```
models/
├── __init__.py
├── comparison.py      # Core comparison data models
├── schema.py          # Schema definitions
├── results.py         # Result data containers
└── validation.py      # Validation result models
```

**Key Changes:**
- Separate data models from business logic
- Use class-level constants for default values and configuration
- Implement proper `__post_init__` validation
- Add comprehensive type annotations

### 2. Service Layer (`services/`)

**Decompose business logic into focused services:**

```
services/
├── __init__.py
├── comparison_service.py    # Core comparison operations
├── validation_service.py    # Data validation logic
├── preparation_service.py   # Data preparation and mapping
└── reporting_service.py     # Report generation (separated from data)
```

**Key Changes:**
- Single responsibility principle per service
- Dependency injection for testability
- Class-level constants for service configuration
- Clear separation of concerns
- **Full API redesign** - No backward compatibility constraints

### 3. Simplified Exception Hierarchy (`exceptions/`)

**Current:** 4 separate exception classes
**Proposed:** Unified exception hierarchy

```
exceptions/
├── __init__.py
└── comparison_exceptions.py
```

**Key Changes:**
- Single exception class with error codes/constants
- Class-level constants for error types
- Simplified inheritance hierarchy

### 4. Utility Modules (`utils/`)

**Current:** Single `type_helpers.py`
**Proposed:** Organized utility modules

```
utils/
├── __init__.py
├── type_helpers.py      # Type checking utilities
├── constants.py         # Shared constants
├── formatting.py        # String formatting utilities
└── file_operations.py   # File I/O utilities
```

## Class-Level Constants Strategy

### 1. Module-Level Constants

Each module will define class-level constants for:

```python
class ComparisonConstants:
    """Constants for comparison operations."""

    # Default values
    DEFAULT_NULL_EQUALS_NULL = True
    DEFAULT_IGNORE_CASE = False
    DEFAULT_MAX_SAMPLES = 10

    # Column prefixes
    PRIMARY_KEY_PREFIX = "PK_"
    LEFT_PREFIX = "L_"
    RIGHT_PREFIX = "R_"

    # Join types
    JOIN_INNER = "inner"
    JOIN_LEFT = "left"

    # Thresholds
    ZERO_THRESHOLD = 0
    DUPLICATE_THRESHOLD = 1
```

### 2. Service-Specific Constants

```python
class ValidationConstants:
    """Constants for data validation operations."""

    # Error messages
    MISSING_COLUMNS_MSG = "Missing columns: {}"
    WRONG_DTYPE_MSG = "Column {}: expected {}, got {}"

    # Validation thresholds
    COMPLETENESS_THRESHOLD = 0.95
    ACCURACY_THRESHOLD = 0.99
```

## Specific Module Decomposition

### 1. `comparator.py` → Multiple Services

**Current:** Single `LazyFrameComparator` class (467 lines)

**Proposed Decomposition:**

#### `services/comparison_service.py`
```python
class ComparisonService:
    """Core comparison operations service."""

    # Class constants
    DEFAULT_JOIN_TYPE = "inner"
    DEFAULT_NULL_HANDLING = "equals"

    def execute_comparison(self, config: ComparisonConfig, left: pl.LazyFrame, right: pl.LazyFrame) -> ComparisonResult:
        """Execute complete comparison between DataFrames."""
        # Implementation focused on orchestration
```

#### `services/preparation_service.py`
```python
class DataPreparationService:
    """Data preparation and mapping service."""

    # Class constants
    PRIMARY_KEY_PREFIX = "PK_"
    LEFT_PREFIX = "L_"
    RIGHT_PREFIX = "R_"

    def prepare_dataframes(self, config: ComparisonConfig, left: pl.LazyFrame, right: pl.LazyFrame) -> tuple[pl.LazyFrame, pl.LazyFrame]:
        """Prepare DataFrames for comparison."""
```

#### `services/validation_service.py`
```python
class ValidationService:
    """DataFrame validation service."""

    def validate_schemas(self, config: ComparisonConfig, left: pl.LazyFrame, right: pl.LazyFrame) -> None:
        """Validate DataFrames against schemas."""
```

### 2. `results.py` → Data Models + Reporting Service

**Current:** 4 classes mixed together (675 lines)

**Proposed Decomposition:**

#### `models/results.py`
```python
@dataclass
class ComparisonSummary:
    """Summary statistics for comparison results."""
    # Pure data container with validation

@dataclass
class ComparisonResults:
    """Container for all comparison results."""
    # Pure data container
```

#### `services/reporting_service.py`
```python
class ReportingService:
    """Report generation and formatting service."""

    # Class constants for formatting
    REPORT_HEADER_LENGTH = 60
    SECTION_SEPARATOR_LENGTH = 40
    PERCENTAGE_MULTIPLIER = 100

    def generate_summary_report(self, results: ComparisonResults) -> str:
        """Generate human-readable summary report."""
```

### 3. `schema.py` → Pure Data Models

**Current:** 4 dataclasses with validation logic (226 lines)

**Proposed:** Pure data models with constants

```python
class SchemaConstants:
    """Constants for schema operations."""

    # Default values
    DEFAULT_NULLABLE = False
    DEFAULT_IGNORE_CASE = False

    # Validation messages
    EMPTY_SCHEMA_MSG = "Schema has no columns defined"
    MISSING_PK_MSG = "No primary key columns defined"

@dataclass
class ComparisonConfig:
    """Configuration for comparing two LazyFrames."""

    # Class constants
    DEFAULT_NULL_EQUALS_NULL = True
    DEFAULT_IGNORE_CASE = False

    # Implementation with pure data and constants
```

### 4. `data_validators.py` → Validation Service

**Current:** Single large validator class (335 lines)

**Proposed:** Focused validation service

```python
class ValidationService:
    """Data quality validation service."""

    # Class constants
    VALIDATION_SUCCESS_MSG = "All validations passed"
    COMPLETENESS_FAILED_MSG = "Completeness validation failed: {} missing columns, {} null columns"

    def validate_completeness(self, df: pl.LazyFrame, required_columns: list[str]) -> ValidationResult:
        """Validate that required columns are present and non-null."""
```

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Infrastructure Setup
1. Create new package structure (`models/`, `services/`)
2. Implement class-level constants pattern
3. Create base service and model classes

### Phase 2: Data Model Migration

## Conclusion

This simplification plan represents a **complete architectural redesign** of the framework, enabled by the fact that this is an initial feature branch with no backward compatibility constraints. We will transform the current monolithic architecture into a clean, modular, and maintainable codebase by aggressively applying SOLID principles and implementing comprehensive class-level constants.

### Freedom to Innovate
Since we don't need to maintain backward compatibility, we can:
- **Redesign APIs from scratch** for optimal usability
- **Eliminate technical debt** accumulated in the original design
- **Implement modern patterns** without legacy constraints
- **Simplify complex interfaces** that evolved organically
- **Establish new conventions** for consistency

### Strategic Advantages
The proposed structure separates concerns clearly, makes configuration explicit through constants, and enables better code organization. This significant refactoring effort will establish a solid foundation for future development, with the new architecture being more maintainable, testable, and extensible than the original.

This is our opportunity to design the framework as it should have been from the beginning, rather than being constrained by existing patterns and interfaces.
